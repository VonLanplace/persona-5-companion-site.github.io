The social stat that will determine your progression in confidants. Most of the activities associated with kindness include having a green thumb such as taking care of the plant in your room or working part-time as a florist. Kindness can also be earned by spending time with confidants like Sojiro, Oda, and the downcast woman at the bar. Invest in Kindness early to eventually have these confidants warm up to you. Other confidants like Futaba and Ann also require a higher level in Kindness to advance. Futaba in particular can provide some useful support skills whenever the party’s in a pinch, so be sure to raise your Kindness for better chances at gaining battle insurance.
