Investing in guts enables you to stand up to people during conversations and approach frightening situations. Guts can be increased a number of ways. Among the social stats, Guts seem to improve from the most diverse and often peculiar of sources. For instance, you can raise Guts by taking Takemi’s clinical trials. Like any other social stat, focus on those that don’t waste game time and those that boost multiple stats. Drinking the weekly beverage or drawing the group’s logo on the blackboard are examples of the former, while doing the Big Bang Burger challenge or spending time at the maid cafe are a few examples for the latter.
