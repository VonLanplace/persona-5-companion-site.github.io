Knowledge is the social stat responsible for your academic performance. The majority of activities that deal with knowledge are school activities, however you can also earn some by solving puzzles, answering questions outside class, and even talking to the Star Confidant. Like all other stats, you’re better off doing activities that give a variety of social stat gains like the Big Bang Burger Challenge. Other than that, you should prioritize activities that don’t eat much game time like answering TV quizzes and drinking the weekly beverage in Shibuya.
