## Overview and Guide about Social Stats

[![](./imagens/sg-p5-social-stats-1024x576.jpg)](./README.md)
Same with older Persona games, the player has a number of social stats to improve in order to advance the story. Persona 5 Royal has two more stats than Persona 3 (Courage, Charm, and Academics.) Persona 4 has the same number of stats as Persona 5 with Knowledge, Expression, Diligence, Understanding, and Courage. The main difference, however, is that Persona 5 needs fewer points for a particular stat to be boosted. Also, Persona 5 has more ways than the previous games to rank up these Social Stats. This is especially useful since the game is based on real-time.
### Social Stats List

|Rank|Knowledge|Charm|Kindness|Guts|Proficiency|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Rank 1|Oblivious|Existent|Inoffensive|Milquetoast|Bumbling|
|Rank 2|Learned|Head-turning|Considerate|Bold|Decent|
|Rank 3|Scholarly|Suave|Empathetic|Staunch|Skilled|
|Rank 4|Encyclopedic|Charismatic|Selfless|Dauntless|Masterful|
|Rank 5|Erudite|Debonair|Angelic|Lionhearted|Transcendent|

Each stat ranges from 0-5. These stats can be increased by earning points in activities. After obtaining a certain number of points, the stat will increase. This then allows you to access certain events that require certain levels of the various stats.

### Social Stats Benefits

Players can unlock various events by leveling their social stats. Some of these events involve Confidants. Certain girls will only date your character if a particular trait has been maxed out. Others, like Proficiency, can be helpful on the field. Players can create lockpicks that open chests that contain extremely valuable items. Higher proficiency makes crafting these lockpicks much easier.

Social stats offer some additional benefits as well. For example, increasing your Knowledge allows you to perform better during tests. Charm helps mainly in unlocking more part-time jobs. Guts grants you the bravery to face people in special cases. Finally, Proficiency makes you more efficient at crafting infiltration tools and unlocks more part-time jobs.
