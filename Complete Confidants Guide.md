# Complete Confidants Guide
## Understanding the Confidant System

Confidants are a key mechanic in the Persona series and represents the bonds you form with others throughout your journey. In Persona 5 Royal, there are 23 Confidants altogether, with 3 that rank up from progressing the story, 2 from completing requests, and the rest following a point progression system of sorts.  
  
Confidant Points can be earned through interactions, with each action potentially providing up to 3♪ depending on the type of interaction and choices you make. Once you meet the required points and trigger a rank up event, the Confidant's points will be reset back to 0, with any points you earn during the event conversation added for the next rank up point requirement.  
  
You also have the ability to gift an item to your Confidants whenever you spend time with them and don't have enough Confidant Points to Rank Up yet. Depending on the item, you may even receive unique dialogue too.

The game actually tracks Confidant Points slightly differently from the music notes you see on screen, and that's due to the multiplier system which will be discussed in more detail later. To put it simply, each action's base notes have an internal Confidant Point value of 5, so an action that gives 2♪ provides 10 Confidant Points. This is then multiplied by the player's growth modifier to get the final value stored in the game. For simplicity sake and establishing a standard, this guide will provide the base internal values to provide info on the lowest possible Confidant Points earned for choosing the best responses.  
  
There are several additional growth multipliers that help boost the amount of points that are received while hanging out. If the protagonist has at least one Persona with the same Arcana as the recipient, the points received will be multiplied by x1.5. The protagonist's performance in an exam will grant a boost to school Confidants until the next exam week: if the protagonist scores 1st place, the multiplier will be x1.5, if top 10, it'll be x1.2. Additionally, if the protagonist immediately accepts a Confidant's invitations without putting it off until later, the hangout event will also be granted a x1.2 multiplier. These factors apply to many instances where Confidant Points can be received without having to directly spend time with them, such as having Sojiro taste the protagonist's coffee, or getting an Affinity Reading from Chihaya.  
  
If the protagonist has reached max bond with a Confidant and entered a romantic relationship with them (if they can be romanced), he can choose to spend time with them (only one of them if multiple romances) on December 24th, at which point they'll gift him a key item that increases the Confidant Point multiplier for having a Persona with their Arcana from x1.5 to about x10. This item will also carry over to New Game Plus.

What Affects Confidant Availability?

Once you start getting more Confidants, you'll soon realize you won't be able to interact with them every day to rank up. After all they have their own things they need to take care of, and you yourself need to juggle between living your life as a student, while also being a phantom thief. In general, every Confidant follows a set schedule, with certain variables affecting whether they'll be available or not. These include needing to meet a certain social stat requirement or completing specific requests. For party member Confidants, they won't be available during the week before the deadline if the current palace hasn't been cleared yet, or after the option to send a calling card has been made available.
